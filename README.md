# Pacman Exercise

This is a fun exercise where you can clone a repository and play a game of Pacman on your browser. By manipulating the DOM, you can add as many Pacmen as you want and watch them bounce around the screen at different speeds and velocities.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository onto your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

>git clone https://github.com/OliverStanciu/PacMen-Exercise.git

Once you have cloned the repository, open the `starter.html` file in your preferred code editor and launch it on your default browser.

## Usage

After opening the `starter.html` file, you will see a button labeled "Add Pacman". Click on this button to add as many Pacmen as you like to the screen.

Once you have added Pacmen to the screen, you can start the game by clicking on the "Start Game" button. The Pacmen will start moving around the screen in different directions and at different speeds.

Feel free to experiment with adding more Pacmen and adjusting their velocities to see how they interact with each other on the screen.

## Contributing

This exercise is a fun and engaging way to learn how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes.
